                              <P>So that we can diagnose the overall usage of the internet data use on different phone models. We capture information about how much you or your device use internet services and consume data. This helps us improve device and network data efficiency for you and other customers based on real world data usage. We log:</P>

                              <P>So that we can identify trends in data usage that help us allocate capacity for data heavy applications in your area, we assess the data use of the applications on your phone. We log:</P>

                              <P>So that we can evaluate the performance of different devices on our network and diagnose phone-related problems and diagnose the overall health of your phone, we log:</P>

                              <P>When we measure the items above related to coverage and usage, we know your rough location from the phone mast and Wi-Fi hot spot your phone is using. When your phone or one of your apps is using GPS location data, we use that to assess location more precisely and sometimes speed if available with GPS information. This enables us to identify areas of weak coverage and determine whether poor performance might be caused by movement. This information will be used to improve poor performance for you and fellow customers.</P>
