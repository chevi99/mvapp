                                            <span class="vlt3 block" style="margin-top:5px;">• &nbsp;To know roaming tariffs send "name of country" to SMS short code 150 to receive the costs.So if you are traveling your phone will work like a local wireless device.</span>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block" style="margin-top:5px;">• &nbsp;Upon arrival, you should learn how to make local calls in the country visited.</span>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block" style="margin-top:5px;">• &nbsp;While roaming outside Ghana be sure to make all international calls using the international format (+, country code, number). For example, to place an international call back to Ghana, dial +233, then the operator code and number (+23320 xxx xxxx). In most GSM devices, holding down the 0 key will cause the + sign to appear.</span>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block" style="margin-top:5px;">• &nbsp;When you are abroad and turn on your phone, it will automatically search for a wireless network. Registration usually occurs within 30-40 seconds. When the name or network number of the local operator is displayed, your phone should be ready to use.</span>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block" style="margin-top:5px;">• &nbsp;Like any other appliance, you will need a universal phone charger and plug adapters for the countries you are visiting.</span>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block" style="margin-top:5px;">• &nbsp;In some countries, using a wireless phone while driving is prohibited. Contact the local tourist information office for regulations that may apply.</span>

                                            <span class="sixts block">1.  What is International Roaming?</span><br>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block">International Roaming allows you to use your mobile number to make and receive calls in countries or destinations while you are overseas.</span>
                                            
                                            <span class="sixts block">2.  What is a GSM world phone?</span><br>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block">A. GSM world phones are devices that operate on international frequencies. These can include "tri-band" phones/devices (which operate on three of the four GSM frequencies) and "quad-band" phones/devices (which operate on all four of the GSM frequencies).</span><br>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block">GSM networks in North and South America operate at frequencies of 850 or 1900 MHz, while most networks in other countries operate at frequencies of 900 or 1800 MHz.  </span> <br>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block">Vodafone Ghana recommends quad band phones/devices for most international travelers. Since these wireless devices operate on all four of the international GSM frequencies, this ensures the broadest international coverage available. </span>
                                            
                                            <span class="sixts block">3.  How do I subscribe to roaming as a business customer? </span><br>
                                            <span class="vlt3 block">For postpaid customers need to call the call center or visit any of our retail shops, can also contact your account manager for activation.</span>

                                            <span class="vlt3 block">When roaming, your mobile phone will search for the strongest signal in that area to be connected. However, in cases where you are not automatically connected to the overseas network, you could do a manual selection of the overseas network on your mobile phone (Check your mobile phone user guide for more help). See 5 below</span>

                                            <span class="vlt3 block">Your phone will display foreign network name if it has logged onto one. The display will vary from phone to phone. </span>

                                            <span class="vlt3 block">The network coverage in that area may be weak, try moving to another area where it gives you a stronger signal. Alternatively, Try manual scanning: <b>Settings>Options>Network>Change network selection to manual>Click scan for new network>Select a network other than the one on which you are currently registered.</b> (Check your phone user guide for more help)</span>

                                            <span class="vlt3 block">Yes, as long as the overseas network you are connected to supports this function, you may send or receive text messages.</span>

                                            <span class="vlt3 block">To retrieve voice mail, dial 0200202020 for direct access to your voice mails. You will be charged at standard roaming rates for this service.</span>
